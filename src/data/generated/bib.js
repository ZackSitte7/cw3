        "abstract": "The worldwide demand for reduction of CO2 pollution, with more penetration of renewable energy sources and an increased number of electric vehicles (EVs), demonstrates the importance of economic dispatch (ED) with taking into account the reduction of CO2 emission. ED is a classical problem in which EVs impose more penetration as a dynamic load, and its impact as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is the possible future trend with cost minimization. Based on the integration of EVs and hybrid renewable sources concerning both economic dispatch and pollution minimization, the multi-objective function is converted into a single comprehensive objective by using the judgment matrix methodology. In this paper, the investigation involves the minimization of the cost of all three objectives viz. operation cost, pollution cost, and carbon emissions with ED by incorporating V2G technology. The algorithms which include particle swarm optimization, as well as artificial bee colony, are applied under various operation and control strategies. The proposed models are verified and analyzed with different case studies. In terms of operation economics, the simulation results validate the superior performance of EVs based microgrid (MG) model in the coordinated charging and discharging mode. Further, the comparison of both algorithms shows better results with the ABC algorithm in terms of cost minimization of all objectives. ABC is better in V2G based microgrid with coordinated charging and discharging mode while its performance is significant during a large number of EVs (i.e., 700 EVs). Moreover, the load shedding scenarios are integrated which enables the MG system to operate in dual mode (i.e., seamless transition). In this paper, the main contribution involves penetration of EVs as dynamic load and its V2G impact in a coordinated or uncoordinated way, application of ABC algorithm for this particular load problem with improved results, and inclusion of short-term load shedding scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Under the situation of unmanned driving, the energy consumption in an electric vehicle\u2019s acceleration process can be reduced by controlling the driving behavior. So in this paper, a pedal control strategy which could optimize the energy consumption of electric vehicle\u2019s acceleration process is proposed. The strategy is generated by the training results of reinforcement learning framework and the specific method of building such framework is discussed in details. Based on the training results of Q-learning-based algorithm, the relationship between the proportion of energy consumption reduction and vehicle\u2019s acceleration time is analyzed, which illustrates the energy-saving potential of the algorithm. In order to improve the control effect of the strategy, an updated algorithm framework based on Deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed and an improved pedal\u2019s control strategy is obtained. Compared with the strategy obtained by Q-learning-based algorithm, the improved strategy not only achieves the same energy-saving effect, but also guarantees the stability of control effect, which is more suitable for actual use.",

        "abstract": "Autonomy is considered an important criterion that characterizes the performance of electric vehicles. It is represented by the distance that could be traveled by a fully electric vehicle which mainly depends on several parameters such as the vehicle model, type of battery, type of motor, etc. In this context, to improve the autonomy of electric vehicles, this paper represents an optimization study for the electric motor based on two contributions. The first devise an energy optimization algorithm to reduce the motor losses by calculation of the stator flux reference according to the electromagnetic torque and the rotation speed. The second is concerned with controller parameters adjustment using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to improve the efficacy and robustness of the drive. The performance of this strategy is evaluated in terms of torque, flux ripples, and transient response to step variations of the torque control. A comparative study of the designed PI controllers based on PSO with four other control algorithms and tuning methods is established in order to prove the efficiency of PI_PSO. The analysis, modeling, and simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the proposed overall optimization study.",

Specifically, a controller based on model predictive control (MPC) is developed to optimize the host vehicle's speed for better energy economy while ensuring good car-following performance and ride comfort. The vehicle's energy consumption is accurately quantified in the form of demand power, which is incorporated in the cost function for energy optimization. The proposed EOCFC strategy is evaluated using three standard test cycles, i.e., New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), in comparison with a typical multi-objective adaptive cruise control strategy. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed EOCFC improves the energy economy of the host vehicle by 0.53%, 3.33% and 1.51%, under the NEDC, UDDS and WLTC test cycles respectively.",

        "abstract": "The trend for the decarbonization of the transportation sector, contributing to climate change mitigation, has driven the accelerated deployment of electric buses in cities. However, higher upfront costs, charging infrastructure deployment and operational issues are the main obstacles to their massive adoption. This work develops an optimization model to deal with the charging schedule of a fleet of battery electric buses. This approach aims to minimize the charging costs of electric bus fleets also considering the ageing of the batteries and the participation in vehicle to grid schemes. We developed a case study using real-world data from a small electric bus fleet of eleven electric buses in a medium-size Portuguese city. Further, we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the possibilities of energy trading with the grid. The results indicate that below a battery replacement cost threshold of 100 \u20ac/kWh, it may become economically attractive for public transportation operators to sell back energy to the grid for a given remuneration scheme. Considering battery degradation and energy selling, our study indicates that operation costs could be 38% lower in 2030. The approach presented in this article provides a tool that can be employed by public transportation operators to assist decision making in the electrification of bus systems. \u2022An optimization model to optimize electric bus fleet charging is developed.\u2022The feasibility of V2G schemes considering battery degradation is evaluated.\u2022Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess energy trading possibilities.\u2022Total cost of ownership analysis evaluates the costs related to energy transactions.",

At the same time, renewable energy can be used for a microgrid nearby, or incorporated into a large grid, to effectively address the volatility of renewable energy sources. Motivated by the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the randomness of renewable energy output, this paper proposes an effective strategy to improve the security and economy of the microgrid system. The uncertainty of wind power and EV\u2019s state of charge (SOC) is modeled as uncertainty prediction sets. And considering the worst-case scenario, this proposed strategy can increase the absorption ratio of renewable energy while orderly guiding the charging and discharging of EVs in peak-load reduction and valley filling and thus, lower operating costs under various practical constraints. To solve the problem of over-conservatism of the robust optimization, this paper introduces a dispatch interval coefficient to adjust the degree of conservatism, while improving the economy of microgrids system. The robustness and feasibility of the proposed dispatch strategy are demonstrated by numerical case studies. \u2022Electric vehicle is introduced as both load and source (V2G mode) to help the consumption of wind power.\u2022Operation stability and economic performance of microgrid is improved with the adjustable robust optimization (RO).\u2022The robustness and economy of the system has been quantified.\u2022Sensitivity analysis of uncertain variables to system total cost is carried out.",

However, high penetration of EVs brings heavy electricity demand to the power grid.\u201d Due to the intermittent character of renewable energy sources (RESs), it turns out to be very challenging to manage EV charging with other renewable generation and grid load. This paper aims to introduce a dispatch strategy assisted with the optimization concept for enhancing the economy of the microgrid system. The major objective is to minimize the cost of system operation and environmental control when meeting system load requirements. The output constraints related to the distributed power supply, such as power limits, are subjected to optimization. To solve this optimization issue, a new \u201cFitness Sorted Moth Search algorithm (FS\u2010MSA)\u201d is introduced. Finally, the proposed work is compared and validated with other existing works with respect to various measures. The enhanced outcomes prove the efficacy of the implemented FS\u2010MSA model. This work concentrates on EV adoption integrated with RES for sustainable mobility. On observing the result, it can be noticed that the adopted scheme was 81.97%, 82.03%, 82%, and 81.97%, better than existing genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), moth search algorithm, and lagrange multiplier optimization (LMO) models for mean case scenario.",
